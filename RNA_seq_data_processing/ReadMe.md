***This section shows how homologous genes between DM1S1 and Solanum verrucosum were selected and differential expression analysis was carried out***

## 01. Finding homologous gene pairs between DM1S1 and Solanum verrucosum

These orthologous genes were identified by, making a BLAST database using the cDNA sequences for all of the genes in the DM1S1 genome. We then used this DM1S1 cDNA BLAST database to search for the best-matching sequences (E value > 1e -3) in the VER genome assembly. DM1S1 sequences with the highest sequence similarity to VER cDNA sequences were classified as orthologous genes.

## 02 Differential expression analysis between VER and DM1S1

To perform this part of the analysis run lines in ***2_calling_differential_expression.R*** 
* find the required input data in the data files directory

## 03 Analyzing the fold chain data and plotting variations 

To perform this part of the analysis run lines in ***3_Fold_change_analysis.R*** 
* Input data for this code will be generated by running 2nd step
